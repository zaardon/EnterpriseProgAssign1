The start web page to this program is 'Login.aspx'. Running this will prompt the user to login 
(see below for accounts). The user will be then prompted to select the Consultant or Supervisor/Staff
aspects of the program.

------RUNNING THE CODE NOTE-------
The App.config file located in 'BlueConsultingManagementSystemTests' and the Web.config file located in
'BlueConsultingManagementSystemUI' requires a hardcoded connectionString to the local database used for authentication.
The database is called DATABASE.MDF and it is located within the App_Data folder inside 'BlueConsultingManagementSystemLogic'.

Commented out examples have been left as an example of how it has been done in both *.config files

----------------------------------


---------TESTING NOTE-------------
It is assumed that the tests will be run prior to any data being added, adopting a test-first practice.
While some aspects will work with the data being changed, others in particular (staff) will not.
